	<p> Dear Science,</p>

	<p>Why do we humans love our pets so much?</p>

	<p>Here's what science has to say:</p>

	<p>“It really is an amazing question,” said Clive Wynne, director of the Canine Science Collaboratory at Arizona State University.</p>

	<p>Wynne has devoted his career to studying animal behavior and the evolutionary relationship between animals and people. He said it's easy to see why our pets would love us: “The success of dogs [and other domesticated creatures] on the surface of the Earth is entirely due to the fact that we take some level of care of them.”
